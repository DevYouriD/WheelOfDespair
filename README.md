## Instructions
To create an Android Kotlin app with both user and admin versions that can trigger events simultaneously across all user/client versions, you'll need to implement a client-server architecture with real-time communication. Here's a high-level overview of the steps to achieve this:

1. **Server Backend**:
   - Set up a server backend that acts as an intermediary for communication between admin and user clients. You can use technologies like Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, or any backend framework you are comfortable with.
   - Implement authentication mechanisms to differentiate between admin and user clients.

2. **Real-time Messaging**:
   - Use a real-time messaging system like WebSockets to establish a persistent connection between the server and all connected clients. WebSocket libraries are available for various programming languages.
   - When a user or admin client connects to the server, they should join a relevant channel or room. Admins join the admin channel, while users join user channels.

3. **Admin App**:
   - Create the admin version of your Android app. This app should have functionalities for the admin to trigger events.
   - When the admin triggers an event, send a WebSocket message to the server with the event data. The server will then broadcast this event to all connected user clients.

4. **User App**:
   - Create the user version of your Android app. This app should have the necessary functionality to receive and respond to events triggered by the admin.
   - When a user client receives an event message from the server via WebSocket, it should process the event and update its UI or perform the required action.

5. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Use a WebSocket library for Kotlin/Android to establish and manage WebSocket connections in your Android apps. Some popular libraries include OkHttp and Scarlet.

6. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Ensure that your server backend has proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to admin functionalities.

7. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test your admin and user apps to ensure they work as expected.
   - Deploy your server backend to a hosting provider or server that can handle WebSocket connections.

8. **Error Handling and Resilience**:
   - Implement error handling and retries in your Android apps to handle network issues and ensure the app can reconnect to the server if the connection is lost.

9. **Security**:
   - Ensure that your WebSocket communication is secure by using secure WebSocket connections (wss://) and following best practices for data validation and sanitization.

10. **Scalability**:
    - If your app is expected to have a large number of users, consider implementing load balancing and scaling strategies for your server backend.

Remember that real-time communication can be complex, so thorough testing and error handling are crucial to ensure a reliable experience for your users and admins. Additionally, consider the scalability requirements and infrastructure needed to support your app's expected user base.
